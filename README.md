<h2>Specification Scenario</h2>
<p>
Podcast.coâ€™s hosting system is now live and people are happily downloading podcast episodes. A new requirement has come in to provide users with time series download data. The existing developers have agreed that for now they will send a webhook event to your application for every episode downloaded. Your task is to handle the webhooks to store download data, then provide an api for the front end team to create a time series downloads chart.
</p>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
The first part of this task is to handle the webhook and store download data in a suitable format to be queried later. The developers expect to send the following request to your solution:
</p>

<pre>
POST /webhook

{ "type": "episode.downloaded", "event_id": "uuid", "occurred_at": "ISO8601 date time", "data": { "episode_id": "uuid", "podcast_id": "uuid" } }

Note, they expect to send different event types in the future.
</pre>

<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>
The front end team would like to build a time series chart showing daily downloads for a particular episode for the last 7 days, they expect this data to be aggregated for them.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to build an api endpoint that provides data that the front end team can use to achieve their goal.
</p>

<h2>Development Details</h2>
<p>Migrations have been added to store some sample data so when you make the API request to store some information.</p>

<p>I have added a postman collection for both end points. I will add more info on that soon</p>

<h1>What I would do if this was going to production</h1>
<pre>
    <ul>
        <li>I would add authentication using a brearer token</li>
        <li>I would have liked to know more about the DB structure, what information the front end required so I could format the response better it better.</li>
        <li>Add more API points depending on need, like do we need to have a delete? or see podcast info?</li>
        <li>Dockerise it / VM</li>
    </ul>
</pre>

<h1>My thoughts on this</h1>
<p>
The spec is to breif, There is not enough information to see the full picture of what is required. Ideally more info on what the font end needed. The relationship between the events, epidoes and podcasts. I have had to assume a lot. I have added some demo data based of these assumptions.  Normally before starting on a task like this I would have discussed with the appopriate parties to get all the required information and discuss options.
</p>

<p>
Initally attempted a docker install of laravel but had issues so opted for just installing and hosted locally using XAMPP.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
